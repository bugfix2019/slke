Most state and private degree programs in Sri Lanka are designed with an unofficial 
assumption that every student has access to internet and computer facility. Skill wise,
most degree programs expect students to have a decent IT and English knowledge. Therefore, 
we did an island-wide survey on laptop buying patterns of university students 
representing all major state and private universities. 
These are our very own findings.

## Why you need a laptop at university

**1. Studying:** At the university, most theory subjects are presented to you in the form of
powerpoint presentations, and you will be asked to read through many online sites, ebooks,
do researches, individual and group projects, make reports, assignments, take spot tests, 
and many study activities using a computer. Also, almost every
institute has an online learning management system and you will get a student account to 
download notes, slides, upload assignments, do online tests etc. 
(e.g. all state uni students have access to Moodle space of their university). 
Whether you need to study alone 
or with friends, a laptop will let you access your study work anytime and anywhere.

**2. Academic Software & Tools:** Most degree programs require you to master the hands-on experience on
professional software tools. These vary from the popular word-excel-powerpoint trio to 
research paper writing tools, CAD software, mathematical software, modelling and
simulations tools, software development tools, CLI-based tools and software runtime environments, 
analytics and forecasting tools, accounting software, architecture and design tools, 
music and video creation tools, information management tools etc. 


**3. Communication:** All the official communication between university administration, 
lecturers, clubs and societies, batch groups, and even among your student groups 
will mostly happen using emails and the learning management system, so you will be getting 
an email account from your university under their domain too. Also, apart from that all the
informal communication, social media life, and communication with your loved ones from distant
families and distant friends will happen through online social media sites (mostly Facebook) 
and instant messaging platforms (mostly Whatsapp and Messenger). To keep up with these 
events, you need access to a laptop in most times. 

**4. Entertainment:** University students are so fortunate that most institutes provide you 
free wifi facilities to all students without any limits. This internet link is normally 
faster than the general broadband speeds you can get for your homes, so most students during
their free time, use this network to stream many edutainment and entertainment content from 
tutorials to movies to games (typical boys!) to teledramas (typical girls!), which they 
can enjoy at leisure times when they are at their boarding places or homes. Even if you don't 
have free wifi facility, in every friends' group, there will be that one guy who is always having
1 or 2 TB portable hard-drive in his backpack, that is full of stuff that literally takes 
his entire life time to finish watching. 

**5. Part-time Online Jobs / Freelancing:** Most students are keen of earning a quick buck by 
providing their skills and knowledge on freelancing and part-time basis via online platforms 
and digital services. Some of students turn into great entrepreneurs by running their own side-hustle
in addition to their degree studies and then improve that business just after completing the 
degree. To activate this potential, you need a reliable laptop by your side at almost all the 
times.

## Common concerns to consider

**1. Battery Life:** Your laptop should be able to run on battery power for 4+ hours at the time of purchase and 
at least 2 hours by the 3rd or 4th year after purchase. When the assignment submission deadline is at 11:55 PM, and
if CEB decides to surprise you with a power cut starting at 9 PM, and you are at home/ boarding place alone, 
searching for a power source won't be very easy (and definitely be risky if your neighborhood is uncool).

**2. Display Quality:** If you use the laptop for graphic and video editing work, go for the best screen you can afford
(Full HD is minimum recommended). If you do heavy level of coding, web design, engineering modeling, 
it is great if you can see more details in screen, which means you need a higher resolution. If you do a lot of writing and
documentation work, make sure your laptop screen has a good colour calibration and white balance (HP and Apple laptops 
has durable screens with fantastic colour settings). 

**3. Storage:** If you work with large files, large-scale projects, you may need a good capacity in your storage devices.
Also, if you do a lot of file system operations (e.g. when a programmer runs the codebase locally, when a designer
creates a graphic/video), data manipulations, batch operations, or use heavy software
tools (e.g. Visual Studio, AutoCAD), you will need a lot of space in the hard-drive. 

**4. Light & Durable Design:** You will be using your laptop on the go most of the times. And, you may need
to bring the laptop for lectures regularly and do in-class activities with it. You may be using it in library, 
canteen, at friends' places, on outdoor benches, at communication shops, at staff room, at admin office, and 
many places. So the laptop should not be delicate, and should be ready to stay alive with all your struggle.

**5. Processing Power:** If you do a lot of data processing, like CAD work, game development, graphic rendering work,
you may need at least i5/i7 with 4 cores. However, these needs can vary, so it is better to double-check with senior
students before you make the final purchase.

**6. Memory (RAM):** If you run programs that load heavy content to its memory (e.g. running virtual machine, running
a Java backend software, creating a CAD design), you need 8/16 GB of RAM definitely. But if you only use word processing 
software and not-so-serious stuff, you are all fine with a 4GB RAM.

**7. Graphic Cards:** If you do gaming, graphic, video designing, you may need a higher grade graphic card based on the
exact type of work you are going to do. The best tip we can provide is to find an already-working laptop for similar type
of work and check it performs. it would be great if you can get advice from your seniors or professional because 
choosing incompatible graphic cards can harm your motherboard very easily.

**8. Wifi Card:** If you are a heavy internet user (e.g. streaming videos on regular basis, install large software
updates regularly, do online freelancing jobs) or you are very impatient on the download speeds in general, 
you may need to have a better wifi card. This is not mandatory, but will definitely make you feel good when you
connect to a slow network. 

**9. Internal Peripherals:** There are very low-grade laptops in the market, with attractive price tags, even labelled
with discounts and special offers for students. Most of them have good looks, but internal hardware and peripherals are
not upto the good standards. One thing you need to know is, every laptop brand has few levels of product qualities to
serve different market segments and you should always choose a decent product, and never get fooled by the cheapest 
price tags in the shelf.

**10. Operating System:** If you study programming, network engineering, security, devops, and related 
technologies, you may need a Linux based OS such as Debian/ Ubuntu (Debian is recommended over Ubuntu) or MacOS since
it is also Unix-based. If you use special software, you may need to check whether it supports your OS too 
(e.g. Microsoft Office package and AutoCAD do not support Linux). 

**11. Warranty:** A normal bachelor degree expands for 4 years on average and your laptop should have 3 or more years of
service warranty including around 2 or more years of manufacturer's warranty. Also, make sure you purchase it from
a reputed vendor who has a long-years of experience in laptop sales and preferably has its own repair and maintenance 
facility.  

**12. Price:** Don't buy either the cheapest or the most expensive in the market. Buy a laptop that lasts for next 4-5 
years with a need for any major upgrade or maintenance work, because simply when you go to a job after completing your 
degree, you probably will get a laptop from your office or you may earn well enough to afford a new laptop with the 
latest features you love.

## FAQ

#### 1. What if I cannot afford a laptop?
The right question should be, how I can find money to buy a laptop. The problem of our education system is, we are 
trained to wait for someone to come and provide us a laptop or some money grant to buy one. You were lucky to get 
the university system (be it private or state), because you have some academic excellence than others. If your
parents cannot provide you a laptop, then that's great, just stop worrying. Prepare a CV, take few copies, and visit 
few well-doing shops or business places in your town, ideally with a guardian if you are a girl. Most shops and workplaces
are short of good talent and they will be ready to pay you around 30,000+ LKR per month to do an office job. Every
bank and finance company will be hiring after-A/L students every year and you can try that too. If you can find some
starting capital, you alone can start a small business too. Also, you can sell your current skills and knowledge 
in many forms such as doing tuition, correcting papers and instructing your junior students coming for tuition of your
past teachers, doing freelance work etc. If you need more help, please let us know, and we will help you to find
a job for you for sure. With a job or business, you can save money for your laptop and all expenses at the university,
there are many students who do that perfectly in Sri Lanka.
