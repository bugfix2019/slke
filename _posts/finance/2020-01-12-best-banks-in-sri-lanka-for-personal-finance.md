Personal finance is all about managing your income, expenses, savings, investments, 
loans, credit, retirement, insurance, taxation, and more. Even though you can find many
ranking indexes and award lists on this topic, they appear to be not-so-true when it
comes to the real service and end-user experience that you and I get from the banks.
Therefore, we made this list to give you a better picture on those who are dedicated to 
provide a great service, and protect the general public from manipulative 
marketing strategies of big banks and financing companies. 

## #1 - Nations Trust Bank <a href="default.asp"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/db/Nations_Trust_Bank_logo.png" alt="NTB Logo" style="width:auto;height:42px;" align="right"></a>

#### What we liked:

- **Mobile app:** NTB has been providing the **best mobile banking experience in Sri Lanka**
for past few years. Sometimes you may not find NTB app in top charts in AppStore/PlayStore, because due to the 
buggy updates in the past, it has lost its reputation a lot. So still, even after
fixing all the issues, the app suffers from past ratings and negative reviews. However, NTB
app is the ideal mobile banking app which undoubtedly can compete with any 
international app. There're so many users who choose NTB over any other bank, because they
are great fans of the mobile app.
- **Online banking:** NTB provides one of the best user experiences with their all online
platforms. With the vibrant colours, great user experience, and so many banking functions, you can
get done almost all your banking activities with a PC or mobile device easily with NTB.
- **Digital orientation:** NTB is a great believer in digital platforms and you can notice it
if you have been a long-term customer. Also, NTB has the best digital standards and processes
that you can find in any Sri Lankan bank.

#### What to improve:

- We did not find any noticeable improvements for NTB. If you know anything, please share with us.

## #2 - Sampath Bank <a href="default.asp"><img src="https://seeklogo.com/images/S/sampath-bank-plc-logo-3B2E87391B-seeklogo.com.png" alt="Sampath Logo" style="width:auto;height:42px;" align="right"></a>

#### What we liked:

- **Mobile app:** Definitely one of the simplest apps with all the main functions expected
from a banking app. Sometimes few glitches occur, and customers have mentioned them clearly as 
in feedback sections of app stores, so let's hope that the bank will respond to them positively in the
upcoming releases.
- **Online banking:** Sampath online banking is so far one of the most feature-rich platforms you can
find in Sri Lanka. Transfers, payments, multiple savings/FD account creation, loans, and
almost all the banking activities are integrated to this platform with a pleasant and very 
intuitive user experience.
- **Web card:** This works like a pre-paid credit card that you can use to make payments online
very safely. If someone steals your card details, they can only take the money only upto the 
amount that you have topped up to that card. 
- **Digital orientation and risk-taking mindset:** Sampath Bank plays a exemplary role facilitating 
so many innovative digital services from PayHere to UStockTrade to more. Sampath Bank is
definitely a trend-setter in Sri Lanka's Fintech domain and is always ready to experiment the 
latest trends and bring the best to their customers. 

#### What to improve:

- **FD Rates:** Among all banks, Sampath is a bank with one of the lowest FD rates. 
This is one of the major 
reasons that people don't choose Sampath Bank as their long-term primary bank even though the bank
is very successful at providing great digital experience and customer service. 
- **Card offers:** Sampath credit and debit cards are good, but not so good like other banks.
This bank can definitely do better.

## #3 - Commercial Bank of Ceylon <a href="default.asp"><img src="https://seeklogo.com/images/C/commercial-bank-logo-9C9098B1B5-seeklogo.com.png" alt="Combank Logo" style="width:auto;height:45px;" align="right"></a>

#### What we liked:

- **Best branch and ATM coverage:** With nearly 900 ATMs island-wide, Commercial Bank has the
**best ATM coverage** in Sri Lanka and no bank can compete with its scale. 
- **Online banking:** We feel meh about ComBank online experience because it provides almost
all the basic services we expect, but the interfaces are very boring and look cluttered 
and unorganized due to too much information and unintuitive design.
- **Loans:** From housing loans to business loans, Commercial Bank is a pioneering bank when
it comes to loans and credit operations. It always offers competitive rates and you cannot go
wrong with them.

#### What to improve:

- **Mobile app:** Each time we open the ComBank mobile app, we feel like going back in time,
like 8-10 years back. Its interface and colours are so boring and outdated. You won't 
find any great features too, it's a basic banking app. 

## #4 - Hatton National Bank <a href="default.asp"><img src="https://cdn.cse.lk/cmt/upload_logo/373_1416824511.jpeg" alt="HNB Logo" style="width:auto;height:35px;" align="right"></a>

#### What we liked:

- **Online banking:** HNB is one of the oldest bank in online banking arena and they have built a lot of
reputation with both personal and business clients with their online platforms. Their platforms are robust enough
to get the work done, but we felt like they are behind the today's trends, especially when it comes to mobile app
and other connected online services.
- **Loans:** Like Commercial Bank, HNB is also a giant in loans arena and there's a huge customer base
around the credit functions of the bank.

#### What to improve:

- **Mobile app:** HNB mobile app is a total failure. Customers hate its complicated interface with 
very cluttered design. There're people who never open up an account with HNB because their mobile
app has a very damaged reputation. 

## #5 - NDB <a href="default.asp"><img src="http://thesundayreader.lk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Aug-12-NDB-empowers-entrepreneurs-through-Business-Banking.png" alt="NDB Logo" style="width:auto;height:50px;" align="right"></a>

#### What we liked:

- **Card offers:** NDB is definitely good at building relationships with businesses and pass the benefits
to clients in many forms such as card offers. In general, they focus more on acquiring people with fixed monthly
income and building a customer base.
